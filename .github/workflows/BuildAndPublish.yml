    steps:
    # Step 1: Checkout the code from the master branch
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    # Step 2: Set up .NET Core (or the appropriate version you're using)
    - name: Setup .NET
      uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v4
      with:
        dotnet-version: 6.0.x
        
    # Step 3: Restore NuGet packages
    - name: Restore dependencies
      run: dotnet restore
      
    # Step 4: Build the solution
    - name: Build
      run: dotnet build --no-restore
      
    # Step 5: Run solution tests
    - name: Test
      run: dotnet test --no-build --verbosity normal

    # Step 6: Publish the build (creates the executable)
    - name: Publish build
      run: dotnet publish ./GameLauncher/GameLauncher.csproj --configuration Release --output ./publish

    # Step 5: Upload the build artifact (the build will be stored in ./publish)

        # If true, an artifact with a matching name will be deleted before a new one is uploaded.
        # If false, the action will fail if an artifact for the given name already exists.

        # Optional. Default is 'false'
